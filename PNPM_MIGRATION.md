# pnpm Migration Summary

## âœ… Successfully Migrated from npm to pnpm

The Zodirectus project has been completely migrated from npm to pnpm. All package management, scripts, and CI/CD workflows now use pnpm.

## ðŸ”„ Changes Made

### 1. Package Management
- âœ… Removed `package-lock.json`
- âœ… Added `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- âœ… Added `.npmrc` with pnpm configuration
- âœ… Updated `.gitignore` to include pnpm-specific files

### 2. Scripts Updated
- âœ… `package.json` scripts now use `pnpm run` instead of `npm run`
- âœ… `prepare` script: `pnpm run build`
- âœ… `prepublishOnly` script: `pnpm test && pnpm run build`

### 3. Documentation Updated
- âœ… `README.md`: All installation and usage examples updated to use pnpm
- âœ… `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Development setup and scripts updated
- âœ… `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`: All references updated to pnpm

### 4. CI/CD Workflows Updated
- âœ… `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Updated to use pnpm
  - Added pnpm setup action
  - Changed cache from 'npm' to 'pnpm'
  - Updated all commands to use pnpm
  - Added `--frozen-lockfile` flag for CI
- âœ… `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Updated to use pnpm

### 5. Configuration Files
- âœ… `.npmrc`: Added pnpm-specific configuration
  - `auto-install-peers=true`
  - `strict-peer-dependencies=false`
  - `save-exact=false`

## ðŸ§ª Verification

All functionality has been verified to work with pnpm:

- âœ… **Dependencies Installation**: `pnpm install` works correctly
- âœ… **Build Process**: `pnpm run build` compiles successfully
- âœ… **Testing**: `pnpm test` - all 9 tests pass
- âœ… **Linting**: `pnpm run lint` - passes with warnings only
- âœ… **CLI**: `node dist/cli.js --version` works correctly

## ðŸ“¦ pnpm Benefits

The migration to pnpm provides several advantages:

1. **Faster Installation**: pnpm is significantly faster than npm
2. **Disk Space Efficiency**: Uses hard links and symlinks to save disk space
3. **Strict Dependency Management**: Better handling of peer dependencies
4. **Monorepo Support**: Better support for monorepos and workspaces
5. **Security**: More secure by default with strict dependency resolution

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Installation
```bash
# Install locally
pnpm add zodirectus

# Install globally
pnpm add -g zodirectus
```

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build project
pnpm run build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run linter
pnpm run lint

# Development mode
pnpm run dev
```

### Publishing
```bash
# Login to npm
pnpm login

# Publish package
pnpm publish
```

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

The project is now fully migrated to pnpm and ready for:

1. **GitHub Repository**: Push to GitHub with pnpm configuration
2. **NPM Publishing**: Publish using `pnpm publish`
3. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions will use pnpm for all builds and tests
4. **Development**: All team members should use pnpm for consistency

## ðŸ”§ pnpm Configuration

The `.npmrc` file contains the following pnpm-specific settings:

```ini
# pnpm configuration
auto-install-peers=true
strict-peer-dependencies=false
save-exact=false
```

This configuration ensures:
- Peer dependencies are automatically installed
- Peer dependency warnings are not treated as errors
- Exact versions are not enforced (allows for patch updates)

## âœ… Migration Complete

The Zodirectus project is now fully migrated to pnpm and all functionality has been verified to work correctly. The project is ready for development, testing, and publishing using pnpm as the package manager.
